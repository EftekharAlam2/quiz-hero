          Question 01 : What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and
          find?
          <br />
          Ans: <br />
          map, filter, forEach and find are all higher level functions which is
          used to maipulate arrays in JavaScript. There are many difference
          between them but the main difference always how they mainpulate array.
          For example, <br />
          <br />
          map function creates a new array by applying a function to each
          element in the original array. <br />
          filter function creates a new array with all the elements that pass
          the test implemented by the provided function. <br />
          forEach function executes a provided function once for each element in
          an array. <br />
          find function returns the first element in an array that satisfies a
          provided testing function. <br />
          <br />
          So, this is the main dfference between these four functions.

          Question 02 : What is the difference between local storage, session
          storage and cookies? <br />
          Ans: <br />
          We know that, sometimes we need to store data on the user's device and
          retrieve it later. Local storage, session storage, and cookies are all
          this mechanisms that web developers use to store data on the user's
          device and retrieve it later. There is a difference between them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Local storage is a type of client-side storage that allows web
          applications to store data without an expiration date. On the other
          hand, session storage is another type of client-side storage that
          allows web applications to store data for a single browser session
          only. Though cookies are small text files that web servers can send to
          a user's device and retrieve later. This is the main difference that
          we can see between local storage, session storage and cookies.

          Question 03 : What is event bubble? <br />
          Ans: <br />
          Suppose we have a button element inside a div element, and we click on
          the button, the click event will first be triggered on the button
          element, and then it will bubble up and trigger the same event on the
          div element that contains the button. If there are more parent
          elements, the event will continue to bubble up until it reaches the
          root element of the document. This event is called the bubble event.
